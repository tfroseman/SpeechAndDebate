###Speech and Debate Webapp

After watching countless tournaments use Excel or another form of spreadsheet program to host, manage, and score tournaments I realized that there had to be a better way.

So I made this. A  meant to be a end all solution for schools to run a speech and debate competition. It is a work in progress so changes will be abundant.

##Built On

The site is built on [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) , [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Handsontable](http://handsontable.com/), and because Laravel ships with elixir which uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) I also use a bit of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
