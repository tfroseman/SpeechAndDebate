##Speech and Debate Webapp

After watching countless tournamnets use Excel or another form of spreadsheet program to host, manage, and score tornaments I realized that there was a better way.

So I made this. A (webapp) that would allow head coaches and judges to mangage all aspects of a speech and debate competition. One can manage students to a school account, Create a competition with ( in theory) any number of rounds as you wished. And have multiple people all work together to tally scores and all be working at the same time. Then afte the competiton is done your results are ready to be emailed and printed for display and awards.
